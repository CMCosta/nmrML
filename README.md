# Editing Instructions

[See the instructions in the wiki](https://github.com/nmrML/nmrML/wiki/nmrML.org-website-editing)

For super-simple teeny-weeny tiny changes,
you can even use the github web-editor:

Go to the nmrML github repository, change to the gh-pages branch,
and navigate to the page you want to change,

e.g. to add news:

[/gh-pages/news/index.html](https://github.com/nmrML/nmrML/blob/gh-pages/news/index.html)

If you are logged in, hit the "Edit" button,
and when done add a "Commit summary" below the edit area
and hit the green "Commit Changes" button. Done!
