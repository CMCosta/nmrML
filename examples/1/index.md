This spectrum is a refererence 1H NMR spectrum of 2-Ketobutyric acid.
The sample was collected at a concentration of 50 mM at pH 7.0 in
H<sub>2</sub>O and refereced to DSS and was collected on a Varian 500
MHz Inova Spectrometer using the first transient of the
tnnoesy-presaturation pulse sequence. This spectrum is one of the
reference spectrum created by <a
href="http://www.hmdb.ca/metabolites/HMDB00005">The Human Metabolome
Project</a> (<a href="http://ualberta.ca">University of Alberta</a>) as
part of a project cataloguing all detectable metabolites in the human
metabolome.
