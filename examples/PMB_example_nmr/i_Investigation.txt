Study Protocol Description	"The fruits were grown and the samples were prepared in France. Seeds were obtained from Clause-Tézier (Portes-lès-Valence, FR). Plants were grown in an open field in Moissac (South-West France). The plant density was 9,200 plants/ha. Irrigation, fertilisation (Table 1) and pathogen-pest control were performed according to standard commercial practices. The variety studied was “Hugo” of the C. melo var. cantaloupensis group. One plantation date was chosen according to standard commercial practices (May) and two other plantation dates were used (April and June). Therefore plants were grown during April-July, May-August or June-September in 2008. The environmental changes were monitored for each variety using basic meteorological data to calculate the duration of insolation (duration of direct irradiance from the sun of at least 120 W/m2) and degree-days (accumulated product of time and temperature between the lower and upper developmental thresholds for each day) from plantation to harvest."	"Extraction of polar metabolites from ground flesh samples for 1H-NMR analysis. The polar metabolites were extracted from the ground melon samples as previously described (1) with slight modifications. The frozen powdered samples were lyophilised and polar metabolites were extracted from 50 mg of lyophilised powder successively with 2 mL of ethanol/water mixtures: 80/20, 50/50 (v/v) and pure water (4 mL) for 15 min at 80°C. The supernatants were combined, dried under vacuum and lyophilised. Two technical replicates were prepared per a biological sample. The lyophilised extracts were mixed with 500 μL of 400 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 6.0, 1mM Ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid disodium salt (EDTA), in D2O, titrated with KOD solution to pH 6 when necessary, and lyophilised again. Each extraction was made twice as technological replicates. The lyophilised titrated extracts were stored in darkness under vacuum at room temperature, before 1H-NMR analysis was completed within one week.

Plant Biol. 2004, 31, 889-902."	"Fruits at commercial maturity were harvested in the morning and transported within two hours of harvest to the laboratory in insulated boxes and processed immediately. For each harvest, 36 melons were selected in order to make 6 homogeneous biological replicates of 6 fruits each. Samples of fruit flesh from the 6 fruits were cubed, combined and immediately deep frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C until grinding in liquid nitrogen (ball grinder, DangoumauTM, Clermont-Ferrand, France). Aliquots of approximately 20 g of frozen powder were quickly placed in 50 ml screw cap tubes and stored at -80oC until shipment."	"The spectra were acquired at 500.162 MHz on a Bruker Avance spectrometer using a 5 mm inverse probe and ambient temperature of 22°C."	"1H-NMR spectra were recorded on each dried titrated extract solubilised in 0.505 mL D2O added with sodium salt of (trimethylsilyl)propionic-2,2,3,3-d4 acid (TSP) at a final concentration of 0.01% for chemical shift calibration, at 500.162 MHz on a Bruker Avance spectrometer using a 5 mm inverse probe and the ERETIC method (Akoka et al., 1999) for quantification as described previously (Moing et al., 2004). Ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid disodium salt was added at a final concentration of 1mM to chelate paramagnetic cations and improve spectrum resolution, especially in the citrate region. Sixty-four scans of 32K data points were acquired with a spectral width of 6000 Hz, acquisition time of 2.73 s, 90° pulse angle and recycle delays of 25 s. An automation procedure (automatic shimming and automatic sample loading) requiring about 40 min per sample was used for data acquisition. Akoka et al., 1999 : Ann. Chem. 71: 2554–2557 Moing et al., 2004 : Funct. Plant Biol. 31: 889-902"	"Preliminary data processing was carried out with TOPSPIN 1.3 software (Bruker Biospin, Karlsruhe, Germany). FIDs were Fourier transformed (0.3 Hz line broadening), manually phased and baseline corrected. The resulting spectra were aligned by shifting TSP signal to zero. Metabolite concentrations in the NMR tube were calculated using metabolite mode of AMIX software (version 3.5.6, Bruker) for calculation of resonance areas, followed by data export to Excel software. Quantification was carried out using the glucose calibration curve and the proton amount corresponding to each resonance for all compounds except fructose, glutamine and glutamate that were quantified using specific calibration curves of the corresponding compound. Then metabolite concentrations in each sample were calculated from concentrations in the NMR tube and sample dry weight. The concentration of each organic or amino acid was expressed as g of the acid form per weight unit. The concentration of NMR unknown compounds was calculated hypothesizing that resonance corresponded to one proton and using an arbitrary molecular weight of 100 Da."
