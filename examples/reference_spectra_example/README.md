### Overview

This spectra is one of the reference spectra created by The Human Metabolome
Project (University of Alberta) as part of a project cataloguing all detectable
metabolites in the human metabolome. The spectra is refererence 1H NMR spectra
of 2-Ketobutyric acid. The sample was collected at a concentration of 50 mM at
pH 7.0 in H<sub>2</sub>O and refereced to DSS and was collected on a Varian 500
MHz Inova Spectrometer using the first transient of the tnnoesy-presaturation
pulse sequence.
